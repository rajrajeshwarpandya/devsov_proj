I am using single knn model as my base for testing knn accuracy varies from 75% to 85%, i used dataset.py to divide the dataset and convert text based ans into numerical ( i didn't normalize it in data code because it was messing accuracy in furthe ensembles)
dataset.py also randomizes the dataset so that i can test the conditions effectively

i created 3 different ensembles 
random forest 
gradient boosting and
